        <h2><strong> Norway</strong></h2>
        <h3>Kongeriket Norge</h3>

        <time datetime="24-01-2019" class="enunciados">ENE, 24, 20</time>
        <p>
          Is a Nordic country in Northwestern Europe whose territory comprises
          the western and northernmost portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula;
          the remote island of Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard are
          also part of the Kingdom of Norway.[note 2] The sub-Antarctic Bouvet
          Island is a dependent territory and thus not considered part of the
          kingdom. Norway also lays claim to the Antarctic territories of Queen
          Maud Land and Peter I Island.

        <h2><strong>Sports</strong></h2>
        <p>
          Sports are a central part of Norwegian culture, and popular sports
          include association football, handball, biathlon, cross-country
          skiing, ski jumping, speed skating, and, to a lesser degree, ice
          hockey. Association football is the most popular sport in Norway in
          terms of active membership. In 2014â€“2015 polling, football ranked far
          behind biathlon and cross-country skiing in terms of popularity as
          spectator sports.[293] Ice hockey is the biggest indoor sport.[294]
          The women's handball national team has won several titles, including
          two Summer Olympics championships (2008, 2012), three World
          Championships (1999, 2011, 2015), and six European Championship (1998,
          2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2014). In association football, the women's
          national team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup in 1995 and the
          Olympic Football Tournament in 2000. The women's team also has two
          UEFA European Women's Championship titles (1987, 1993). The men's
          national football team has participated three times in the FIFA World
          Cup (1938, 1994, and 1998), and once in the European Championship
          (2000). The highest FIFA ranking Norway has achieved is 2nd, a
          position it has held twice, in 1993 and in 1995.[295] Chess is also
          gaining popularity in Norway. Magnus Carlsen is the current world
          champion.[296] There are about 10 Grandmasters and 29 International
          Masters in Norway.
