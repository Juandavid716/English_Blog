          Norway, "What is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear this word?" Vikings, Nordics, Nobel prizes, Oslo, Castles, Magnus Carlsen "etc. These are some of the things that are said when talking about Norway , but are these stereotypes really like that?
          To talk about it, it is necessary to go back to the past and observe that the Norwegians were called Vikings, and the physical characteristics were very different from what they are today. Muscular bodies, reddish beard, long hair and orange tone, special helmets, steel shields and an aggressive and detonating personality formed the biotype of Viking society. This society was transported in dragon-shaped ships in the fearsome seas of the Mediterranean and they all lived in special and walled castles in what today constitutes the city of Oslo. Returning to the present, it is strange to see how we went from having those qualities so particular to be more peaceful and formal, stand out in sports such as Chess (the current World Champion is the Norwegian Magnus Carlsen), organize the Nobel prizes together are Sweden and be The best places to live in the world. In this way, it is curious and satisfying that stereotypes represent us positively and are not far from reality.
