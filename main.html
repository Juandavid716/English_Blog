        <h2><strong>Norway - Stereotypes over time</strong></h2>

          Norway, "What is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear this word?" Vikings, Nordics, Nobel prizes, Oslo, Castles, Magnus Carlsen "etc. These are some of the things that are said when talking about Norway , but are these stereotypes really like that?
          To talk about it, it is necessary to go back to the past and observe that the Norwegians were called Vikings, and the physical characteristics were very different from what they are today. Muscular bodies, reddish beard, long hair and orange tone, special helmets, steel shields and an aggressive and detonating personality formed the biotype of Viking society. This society was transported in dragon-shaped ships in the fearsome seas of the Mediterranean and they all lived in special and walled castles in what today constitutes the city of Oslo. Returning to the present, it is strange to see how we went from having those qualities so particular to be more peaceful and formal, stand out in sports such as Chess (the current World Champion is the Norwegian Magnus Carlsen), organize the Nobel prizes together are Sweden and be The best places to live in the world. In this way, it is curious and satisfying that stereotypes represent us positively and are not far from reality.

        <h2> <strong> Norway Vs Colombia: Gender Stereotypes </strong></h2>
        <h3><em> Are the role of the man and woman same in both countries?</em></h3>

      <figcaption><em>A comparison between Norway and Colombia Gender Stereotypes</em></figcaption>

        <p> In the world there are gender stereotypes that influence the behavior of people in each society and culture. However, in some countries these stereotypes are more evident than others. For example: In Norway, gender equality is more common than in Colombia. In the latter case, women are seen as housewives with childcare responsibilities, men's dependents, uneducated and whose role is being a mother or being seen as object of desire. These characteristics attributed to Colombian women are found mainly in advertisements and commercials, generating an erroneous conception of women and in turn, showing men as the only one who has work in the family and provides money and food, that Dominant, strong, without feeling, professional and independent. Consequently, Colombians tend to have habits taking into account their gender and make decisions such as: playing sports that imply greater strength or dexterity (men), performing household chores (women) etc. and they are facts that transcend even companies, which usually pay men more than women for doing the same job.

      <figcaption><em>Colombian women are not so willing to leave housewife role</em></figcaption>
        <p> On the other hand, the opposite is true in Norway: Norwegian women are independent, have great jobs, are self-sufficient, hold important positions in government and have no specific roles to follow. This is largely due to the fact that gender-based courtesy policies are absent in Norwegian policies.  However, there is no complete equality and that is why Norway also presents cases of machismo, since work areas such as science are conceived by Norwegians as: men's careers, which is explained due to the greater number of scientists Men than women. Also in Norway, rape rates are very high, which is very contradictory due to the gender equality that exists in the country. </p>
        
        <p> 
        Finally, we can conclude that gender stereotypes influence people's behavior and that although it is present to a greater extent in one country than another, it still remains to be fought so that it is completely fulfilled.
