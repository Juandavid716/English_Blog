        <h2><strong>Norway - Stereotypes over time</strong></h2>

          Norway, "What is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear this word?" Vikings, Nordics, Nobel prizes, Oslo, Castles, Magnus Carlsen "etc. These are some of the things that are said when talking about Norway , but are these stereotypes really like that?
          To talk about it, it is necessary to go back to the past and observe that the Norwegians were called Vikings, and the physical characteristics were very different from what they are today. Muscular bodies, reddish beard, long hair and orange tone, special helmets, steel shields and an aggressive and detonating personality formed the biotype of Viking society. This society was transported in dragon-shaped ships in the fearsome seas of the Mediterranean and they all lived in special and walled castles in what today constitutes the city of Oslo. Returning to the present, it is strange to see how we went from having those qualities so particular to be more peaceful and formal, stand out in sports such as Chess (the current World Champion is the Norwegian Magnus Carlsen), organize the Nobel prizes together are Sweden and be The best places to live in the world. In this way, it is curious and satisfying that stereotypes represent us positively and are not far from reality.

        <h2> <strong> Norway Vs Colombia: Gender Stereotypes </strong></h2>
        <h3><em> Are the role of the man and woman same in both countries?</em></h3>

      <figcaption><em>A comparison between Norway and Colombia Gender Stereotypes</em></figcaption>

        <p> In the world there are gender stereotypes that influence the behavior of people in each society and culture. However, in some countries these stereotypes are more evident than others. For example: In Norway, gender equality is more common than in Colombia. In the latter case, women are seen as housewives with childcare responsibilities, men's dependents, uneducated and whose role is being a mother or being seen as object of desire. These characteristics attributed to Colombian women are found mainly in advertisements and commercials, generating an erroneous conception of women and in turn, showing men as the only one who has work in the family and provides money and food, that Dominant, strong, not feeling, professional and independent. Consequently, Colombians tend to have habits based on their gender and make decisions such as: playing sports that imply greater strength or skills (men), performing household chores (women) etc. And they are facts that transcend even companies, which usually pay men more than women for doing the same job.
        </p>

      <figcaption><em>Colombian women are not so willing to leave housewife role</em></figcaption>
        <p> On the other hand, the opposite is true in Norway: Norwegian women are independent, have great jobs, are self-sufficient, hold important positions in government and don't have specific roles to follow. This is largely due to the fact that gender-based courtesy policies are absent in Norwegian policies.  However, there is no complete equality and that is why Norway also presents cases of chauvinism, since work areas such as science are conceived by Norwegians as: men's careers, which is explained due to the greater number of scientists Men than women. Also in Norway, rape rates are very high, which is very contradictory due to the gender equality that exists in the country. </p>
        
        <p> 
        Finally, we can conclude that gender stereotypes influence people's behavior and that, although it is present to a greater extent in one country than another, it still remains to be fought so that it is completely fulfilled.

      <h2> <strong> The Lewis Model: Linear-Active Vs Multi-Active</strong></h2>
      <h3><em>What would happen if a Norwegian lived in Colombia? </em></h3>
      <time datetime="08-02-2020" class="enunciados">FEB, 16, 20</time>

      <p> If a person from Norway had to stay in Barranquilla, whether to study or work, it would really be difficult. This is due to the difference in culture between the two countries, which are classified into 2 categories by the Lewis model: Linear-Active (Norway) and Multi-Active.</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong> Linear-Active: </strong> are those countries in which its citizens organize their day through schedules, appointments, calendars etc. Therefore they are very punctual with the fulfillment of each plan step by step.</li>
        <li>
        <strong>  Multi-Active: </strong> the inhabitants located in this category are characterized by performing multiple tasks at the same time, so they do not have a fixed schedule and prefer to give priority to reality rather than what is planned in an agenda or schedule.
        </li>

      </ol>

    <figcaption><em>The lewis model categorize different types of cultures</em></figcaption>

      
      <p>Once we know this, we realize that the cultural shock between Norway and Colombia can generate many problems for our foreign friend. In Barranquilla people do not follow a schedule as such and as a result, many times the events start late or people attend late, so as a advice it is recommended not to get angry about these situations that will be common in your daily life, as well as make contingency plans based on the minutes I thought it would take a person to attend, for example: an event. That is, if we want to start an event at 8 am, it is best to quote people at 7:30 to make sure they arrive at the desired starting time. In case you have to attend an interview or class, remain punctual as it has been all your life, only this time taking into account that the class will not start at the time of the incident.
      </p>

      <p> Another advice that can be given is that you learn to perform multiple tasks so take your time to do so, in order to understand a little more the Colombian culture and especially Barranquilla Culture. </p>
