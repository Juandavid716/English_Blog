      <h2>Kongeriket Norge</h2>

      <time datetime="24-01-2019" class="enunciados">ENE, 24, 20</time>
      <p>
        Is a Nordic country in Northwestern Europe whose territory comprises the
        western and northernmost portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula; the
        remote island of Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard are also part
        of the Kingdom of Norway.[note 2] The sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island is a
        dependent territory and thus not considered part of the kingdom. Norway
        also lays claim to the Antarctic territories of Queen Maud Land and
        Peter I Island.

      <h1><b>Sports</b></h1>
      <p>
        Sports are a central part of Norwegian culture, and popular sports
        include association football, handball, biathlon, cross-country skiing,
        ski jumping, speed skating, and, to a lesser degree, ice hockey.
        Association football is the most popular sport in Norway in terms of
        active membership. In 2014â€“2015 polling, football ranked far behind
        biathlon and cross-country skiing in terms of popularity as spectator
        sports.[293] Ice hockey is the biggest indoor sport.[294] The women's
        handball national team has won several titles, including two Summer
        Olympics championships (2008, 2012), three World Championships (1999,
        2011, 2015), and six European Championship (1998, 2004, 2006, 2008,
        2010, 2014). In association football, the women's national team has won
        the FIFA Women's World Cup in 1995 and the Olympic Football Tournament
        in 2000. The women's team also has two UEFA European Women's
        Championship titles (1987, 1993). The men's national football team has
        participated three times in the FIFA World Cup (1938, 1994, and 1998),
        and once in the European Championship (2000). The highest FIFA ranking
        Norway has achieved is 2nd, a position it has held twice, in 1993 and in
        1995.[295] Chess is also gaining popularity in Norway. Magnus Carlsen is
        the current world champion.[296] There are about 10 Grandmasters and 29
        International Masters in Norway.
